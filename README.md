## Introduction

This application answers the Nanois.ai full stack assesment project using JavaScript (NodeJS and browser). At the same time it shows most of the points I consider important: not only code and tests but also continuous integration and deployment using travis and google cloud.

For me this wasn't a short test, so given that I was going to give it some time, I decided to learn also something new. I will point out during this document which parts were new and my take on them.

I will continue explaining each one of these sections: frontend, backend, db, end to end tests, and deployment. 

### Requirements

Node 10.9.0 and yarn are required to run the application in development mode. Docker and docker-compose to run backend service tests and end to end tests

## Frontend
